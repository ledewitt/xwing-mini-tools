The squad creator needs to load the card data from the data files.

Maybe I should create a database that houses the cards informaiton instead
of text data files.

If I do this the individual squads of users can then also be saved in the
database.

The builder would need to calculate squad costs on the fly as the user
changes the make of a squad.

Calculation of meta data such as total life points (hull+shield) of all ships,
total attack and defense dice of the squad.  Other data maybe something like
average dice per attack or defense.

The working environment will start out as a web service maybe a stand alone
executable application later.
