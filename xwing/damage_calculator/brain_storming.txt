The calculator needs to be able to run simulations as will as figure out true
odds.

Simulations first as Monte Carlo Simulations, to start.

Need to load dice faces from the data file into an array for creation of sample
roles.

Average hits in the case of unmodified roles, roles modified with a target
lock, a focus token, or both a target lock and a focus token.

Average defensive evades in the case of unmodified roles, roles modified with
a focus token.

Nice to figure out either the Standard Deviation or quartiles maybe both.
